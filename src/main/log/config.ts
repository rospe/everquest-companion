 * MEMOIZED DISCOVERY — measured, not a micro-optimization (docs/plans/chunked-replay.md's

 *
 * `discoverEqRoot(realProbes())` reads eight registry trees and then stats six candidate paths on
 * every fixed drive. It used to SPAWN those eight reads as `reg query … /s` subprocesses over the
 * whole Uninstall hive, MEASURED at ~150 ms, synchronously, on the main process — and it SCALED
 * with the machine: a large Uninstall hive made the reg queries slow, and an offline mapped
 * network drive makes the drive walk block on the SMB timeout (the config-dependent 30 s boot
 * hang a user reported). The registry half is now an in-process read (~6 ms, JOS-184), so what
 * is left to memoize is mostly the disk half — the caching below is unchanged either way, since
 * the drive walk was always the part that could stall for tens of seconds. `resolveEqDir()` is
 * not a startup-only call either: `character:list` runs it while the renderer hydrates (the ONE
 * main-loop stall left in an otherwise chunked replay), the Settings pane runs it, and
 * `presence.ts` runs it on every watcher tick.
 *
 * TWO CACHE LAYERS (JOS-112), each with a self-heal:
 *   * IN-PROCESS: `discoveredRoot` memoizes the answer for this process. A cached hit is
 *     RE-VALIDATED with `rootHasLogs` — one readdir — so an install that moves or is uninstalled
 *     under us re-probes immediately rather than serving a dead path forever.
 *   * ACROSS LAUNCHES: a POSITIVE result is persisted (`eqDiscoveredRoot` in the store) so the very
 *     next launch skips the whole sweep — `resolveDiscoveredRoot` (discovery.ts) revalidates it
 *     with the same one readdir, drops it if it no longer holds, and NEVER persists a null.
 *
 * `invalidateEqDiscovery()` drops BOTH layers, and is called when the user changes the manual
 * override (session.ts's `applyEqDirChange`) — the one moment a person can tell us that where EQ
 * lives has changed. Nothing else is cached: `countCharacterLogs` still reads the directory on
 * every call, because "how many characters are there" changes while the app runs.
