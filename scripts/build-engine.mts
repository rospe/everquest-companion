/**
 * build-engine.mts — the RELEASE `engined.exe` the installer ships (JOS-473, phase 3), and the
 * ONE place in this repo that knows where `cargo` lives.
 *
 * `npm run build:engine`. It runs before electron-builder in both `dist` scripts, and as its own
 * step in the CI jobs that package (.github/workflows/build.yml), because electron-builder's
 * `extraResources` treats a missing source as a WARNING and carries on — verified in
 * app-builder-lib 26 (`fileMatcher.copyFiles`: `log.warn(…, "file source doesn't exist")` and
 * `return`). An installer that quietly shipped without its engine is exactly the v0.3.1 shape
 * (a release that "succeeded" with assets absent), so the assertion at the bottom of
 * `buildEngineRelease` is the load-bearing line in this file, not the spawn above it.
 *
 * ONE CARGO RESOLUTION FOR THE WHOLE REPO. `tests/e2e/build.mts` used to carry its own copy of
 * `cargoBinary()`; it now imports this one. A second copy is not a duplication in the tidiness
 * sense — it is a machine where the e2e gate finds a toolchain and the shipping build does not.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE SPAWNS POWERSHELL, at build time or any other time (engine/Cargo.toml states the
 * rule for everything under engine/, and plan ruling 16 is why it exists: PowerShell binaries are
 * the antivirus trigger this app already spent a release eliminating). cargo is invoked directly,
 * as a real argv, never through a shell.
 *
 * DEBUG IS NOT AN OPTION HERE, and that asymmetry with the e2e gate is deliberate. The e2e suite
 * builds DEBUG because that is what the resolver probes first and what a developer just produced;
 * an installer ships RELEASE because it runs on somebody else's machine beside a game.
